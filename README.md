# Setup Guide

## Environment
To use our web app, you will need to set up your Conda environment. If you don't have Miniconda/Anaconda installed, download it from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/main/miniconda.html).

To import the Conda environment, use the following command:
- conda env create -n DBMS --file environment.yml

If you wish to update the environment, use the following command:
- conda env update -f environment.yml --prune

## API keys

## Run the application
When you have finished the previus steps, make sure that your environment is active, you may run.
conda activate DBMS

To run the program, navigate to the root directory and execute the following command:
- python src\main.py

This will launch the application in its default state. There are two optional arguments you can use:
- `-fs` or `--from_scratch`: Initiates the Twitter database without a dataset.
- `-r` or `--reset`: Resets the database from scratch or from the dataset (default).

Example of running the program from scratch and resetting the database:
- python src\main.py -fs -r
